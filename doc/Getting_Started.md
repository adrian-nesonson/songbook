Getting Started with Songbook
=============================

This tutorial will help you to get started with Songbook.

Get your server
---------------

First you must get your own server working.
Check one of this methods to start your server:

* [OpenShift](doc/Install_On_OpenShift.md)
* [Docker](doc/Install_With_Docker.md)
* ...


Write access
------------

Now that your server is up, this section presents you how to add and edit songs.

Songbook write access is granted when giving a key as a URL parameter. 
The key is generated when the server is run the first time.
An alert is presented then until the site is accessed using the newly generated key.
![AdminKeyAlert](https://github.com/llgcode/songbook/raw/master/doc/img/adminKeyAlert.png) 

Remember to store the key by bookmarking the address.
If you wan't to share write access with someone, just send the URL with the key.

Accessing your server with the admin key adds to the navigation several buttons:

* A pen to Edit a song.
* A plus to add a new song.
* A minus to remove a song.
