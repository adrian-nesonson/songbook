<div class='song-line'>I can't give you everything you want</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>But I could give you what you thought you need.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>A map to keep beneath your seat, you've been to me in time I'll get you there.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>I fold it up so we don't find our way back soon, nobody knows we're here.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>We can park the van and walk to town</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>And talk about the road behind how getting lost is not a waste of time.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>The water moor will take us home in the moment we will sing as the forest sleeps.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Well it's all for the sake of arriving with you</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Well it's all .. for the sake of arriving with you</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Well, I will make the table into a bed</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>The candle is burning down its time to rest.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>I can't take back things already gone, but I could give you promises for keeps.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>And I would only take them back if they become your own and you give them to me .</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>And it's all for the sake of arriving with you.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Well it's all for the sake of arriving with you.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>We could make this into anything</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>We could make this into more than words we speak.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>This could make us into anything</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>It could make us grow and become what we'll be.</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>Mmmmmm...</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>How and we really know</div>
<div class='song-chords'></div>
<div class='song-line'>It's just like it feels.</div>
