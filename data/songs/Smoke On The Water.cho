Riff (chords):
[G] [C] [D] [G] [C] [Eb] [D] [G] [C] [D] [C] [G]

[G]We all came out to Montreux 
On the Lake Ge[C]neva shore[G]line
[G]To make records with a mobile 
We [C]didn't have much [G]time
[G]Frank Zappa and the Mothers 
Were at the best [C]place a[G]round
[G]But some stupid with a flare gun 
Burned the place [C]to the [G]ground

{soc}
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water [G]and fire in the sky
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water
{eoc}

Riff

[G]They burned down the gambling house 
It died with an [C]awful [G]sound
[G]A funky Claude was running in and out 
Pulling kids [C]outa the [G]ground
[G]When it all was over 
We had to find a[C]nother [G]place
[G]But Swiss time was running out
[G]It seemed that we would [C]lose the [G]race

{c:Chorus}

Riff

[G]We ended up at the Grand Hotel 
It was empty [C]cold and [G]bare
[G]But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
[C]Making our music [G]there
[G]With a few red lights a few old beds 
We made a [C]place to [G]sweat
[G]No matter what we get out of this 
I know we'll [C]never for[G]get

[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water [G]and fire in the sky
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water

Riff
